  		<p>Speaking about the role of the newest technologies for philological researchers, first of all, we need to talk about computer programs and neural networks. Now there are very convenient databases (the most famous example is electronic libraries with any possible texts), so scientists can spend less time searching for the necessary information. <br>Also in our time it has become much easier to publish scientific works and become a sited researcher, and this, in turn, gives young philologists access to invaluable resources for new research. The Internet helps researchers around the world forget about the many difficulties that existed in the past (language barrier, limited literature, state borders) and focus on science. <br>Summing up, it is safe to say that modern technologies make the scientific community better.
